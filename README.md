# Intro
This is the paper that was written for my Writing Project as part of my Master's Degree. There are two other files in this repository: the report file is the pdf output and the code file is the R Markdown file containing the code I used to scrape, wrangle and clean the data, as well as run and assess the models.

# Abstract
Many Division I Track and Field athletes have the goal of qualifying for the West or East Regional meets. Over the past few years, particularly after 2020, the marks required to get into these meets have gotten substantially tougher after many years of being relatively stagnant. This is especially true in middle and long distance running events. This paper looks at the menâ€™s 800 meters in particular. By using quantile regression, which is a variation of linear regression in which we model a quantile of a distribution instead of its mean, we seek to determine the size of this effect. By comparing different models for the changes over recent years, we are able to assess the changes in qualifying times before and after 2020.
